**AutoRDPwn** is a post-exploitation framework created in Powershell, designed primarily to automate the **Shadow** attack on Microsoft Windows computers. This vulnerability (listed as a feature by Microsoft) allows a remote attacker to **view his victim's desktop without his consent**, and even control it on demand, using tools native to the operating system itself.

  Description: Notes for RDP
  Note: |
    Developed by Microsoft, the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is designed to enable a graphical interface connection between computers over a network. To establish such a connection, RDP client software is utilized by the user, and concurrently, the remote computer is required to operate RDP server software. This setup allows for the seamless control and access of a distant computer's desktop environment, essentially bringing its interface to the user's local device.
