**Local Key Storage**

Private keys are generated and stored **locally** on the user‚Äôs device: browser local storage (desktop) or Secure Enclave/Keystore (mobile). Coinbase has **no access** to these keys ‚Äî the wallet is self-custodial.



Execution: node get-key.mjs
```typescript

import { Wallet } from "ethers";

// Replace with your actual 12-word recovery phrase
const mnemonic = "your twelve word mnemonic phrase here";

const wallet = Wallet.fromPhrase(mnemonic);
console.log("Address:", wallet.address);
console.log("Private Key:", wallet.privateKey);
```

12 word recovery phase can be recovered from the app.

The Coinbase Wallet (browser extension, mobile app, or web) uses a 12-word recovery phrase (also called a seed phrase) to generate and store your private key.

### **üîê What Happens Under the Hood**

| **Component**           | **What It Does**                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Coinbase Wallet App** | When you first create a wallet, it generates a **12-word mnemonic phrase** using the BIP39 standard.         |
| **Seed Phrase**         | This 12-word phrase deterministically generates your **private key(s)**.                                     |
| **Private Key**         | Stored **encrypted** in your browser (Firefox, Safari, Chrome, etc.), and **derived from** the 12-word seed. |
| **You Are Custodian**   | Coinbase **does not store** your seed phrase or private keys ‚Äî you must back them up manually.               |

# Sign in options. 
**BLUF:** The website (keys.coinbase.com) gives you **multiple sign-in options** because **WebAuthn (Passkeys)** supports a _range_ of authenticators ‚Äî all of which can securely access your **private key or passkey credentials**. The private key **doesn‚Äôt have to be in a single place**, but must be **available to the authenticator method you choose**.

### ** Why are there three sign-in options?**
![](https://i.imgur.com/50EIfAM.png)


|**Option**|**Where Private Key Is Stored**|**What Happens**|
|---|---|---|
|**Passwords (Apple devices)**|Stored in Apple Keychain (local or iCloud)|Uses Face ID / Touch ID to unlock and sign|
|**iPhone/iPad/Android device**|Stored in secure enclave of mobile device|Uses QR/WebAuthn over BLE/NFC/camera to sign|
|**Security key**|Stored in external hardware (e.g., YubiKey)|Requires physical key + PIN/tap to sign|

In all 3 cases, you‚Äôre proving ownership of the **same identity** (i.e., your Coinbase Wallet or crypto keypair) ‚Äî just via different authenticators.
