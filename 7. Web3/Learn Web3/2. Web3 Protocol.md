### **🧠 BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):**

WalletConnect and Injected Providers are the two main ways that your wallet (like Coinbase Wallet or MetaMask) connects to decentralized apps (dApps) so you can sign transactions, view balances, and interact securely—without giving away your private keys.

---

### **1. Web3 Provider: What Is It?**

  

A **Web3 Provider** acts as a communication bridge between your **wallet** and a **dApp (decentralized application)**. It allows the dApp to:

- Request access to your wallet address (public key)
    
- Ask you to sign transactions
    
- Read data from the blockchain

### **2. Types of Web3 Providers**

|**Method**|**Usage Scenario**|**How It Works**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Injected Provider**|Browser extension / embedded wallet|The wallet injects a JavaScript object (window.ethereum) into the web page|MetaMask on Chrome|
|**WalletConnect**|Mobile or desktop apps|Uses QR codes or deep linking to connect via a bridge server|Coinbase Wallet on iPhone|

### **3. How Injected Providers Work**

- When you install MetaMask (or similar) in a browser, it injects a window.ethereum object into every webpage.
    
- A dApp checks for this object to detect if a wallet is available.
    
- You click “Connect Wallet” → MetaMask opens → You approve → dApp can now interact with your account.

### **4. How WalletConnect Works**

- WalletConnect uses a **bridge server** to create a secure connection between your browser and your wallet app.
    
- The dApp generates a **QR code**.
    
- You scan it with your Coinbase Wallet app.
    
- A session is created, allowing the app to send transaction requests to your phone, where you approve or reject them.
    

---

### **5. Security Design**

- 🚫 **Private keys are never shared** with the dApp.
    
- ✅ All signing happens inside the wallet (browser extension or mobile app).
    
- 🔒 **Session data** is encrypted when using WalletConnect.
