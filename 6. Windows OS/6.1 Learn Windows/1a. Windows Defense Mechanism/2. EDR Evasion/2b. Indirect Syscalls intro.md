Indirect syscalls use a jump to dynamically resolve the syscall location inside `ntdll.dll`.

 Indirect syscalls help avoid detection by maintaining a more natural execution flow.

### **Indirect Syscall Workflow:**  
1. Locate the `ntdll.dll` export for the target syscall dynamically at runtime.  
2. Extract the syscall stub address and jump to its location.  
3. Execute the syscall via the legitimate `ntdll.dll` mapping, maintaining a normal call stack.  
4. Return the result to user-mode.
