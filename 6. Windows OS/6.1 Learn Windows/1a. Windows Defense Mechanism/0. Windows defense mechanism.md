| Defense Mechanism                    | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Windows Defender Antivirus           | Provides real-time protection against viruses, malware, and other malicious software through signature-based and heuristic detection.                        |
| Windows Defender Firewall            | Controls inbound and outbound network traffic to block unauthorized access and protect against network-based attacks.                                        |
| Windows Defender SmartScreen         | Helps protect users by blocking malicious websites and downloads, warning against unrecognized apps and files.                                               |
| Windows Defender Exploit Guard       | Uses a set of built-in rules to reduce the attack surface by mitigating common exploits, such as memory corruption vulnerabilities.                          |
| Windows Defender Application Guard   | Isolates untrusted websites and applications using containerization, helping protect the system from browser-based threats.                                  |
| Windows Sandbox                      | Provides a temporary, isolated environment where untrusted applications can run without affecting the host system, ensuring safe testing.                    |
| BitLocker                            | Offers full-disk encryption to safeguard data on a device, making it inaccessible if the hardware is lost or stolen.                                         |
| Credential Guard                     | Uses virtualization-based security (VBS) to isolate and secure user credentials and other sensitive information from compromise.                             |
| Device Guard                         | Combines hardware and software security features to lock down devices, ensuring that only trusted applications run, particularly in enterprise environments. |
| Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules | Enforce policies that restrict behaviors commonly exploited by malware, reducing potential entry points for attacks.                                         |
| Windows Hello                        | Provides biometric and PIN-based authentication methods that enhance user login security, reducing reliance on passwords.                                    |
