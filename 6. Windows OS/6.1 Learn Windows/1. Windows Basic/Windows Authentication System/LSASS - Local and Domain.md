### 1.0 Local Security Authority Subsystem Service
LSASS is a process rather than a file. As we can see from `Task Manager`, it runs as SYSTEM.

According to Microsoft's website: 

> The LSA security subsystem provides services to both the kernel mode and user mode for validating access to objects, checking user privileges, and generating audit messages.

I noticed LSA and LSASS from the above website, but I simply had no clue what they were. A quick description of LSA and LSASS was found on StackExchange:

> There is "LSA" the concept, and "lsass.exe," a process that implements many of the functions of LSA.
