Windows Credentials Manager

The [Windows Credentials Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/windows-authentication/credentials-processes-in-windows-authentication#windows-vault-and-credential-manager) lets users store credentials for systems and websites in the secure Windows Vault.
>Credential management by using Credential Manager is controlled by the user on the local computer. Users can save and store credentials from supported browsers and Windows applications to make it convenient when they need to sign in to these resources.
>
>When a website, an application, or another computer requests authentication through NTLM or the Kerberos protocol, a dialog box appears in which you select the Update Default Credentials or Save Password check box. This dialog box that lets a user save credentials locally is generated by an application that supports the Credential Manager APIs. 


I can access Credential Manager via the following commands. 

```
>control.exe keymgr.dll
```
