# **Python Requirements Overview**

  

This document explains the Python packages used in the project, their specific versions, and their roles in the RAG-CAG pipeline.

---

### **streamlit>=1.32.0**

- Interactive web framework for Python.
    
- Provides a local UI for document upload and chat.
    
- Optional (can be removed if using Open WebUI only).
    

---

### **PyPDF2>=3.0.1**

- Parses and extracts text from PDF files.
    
- Useful for fallback parsing when Docling isn’t used or OCR fails.
    

---

### **requests>=2.31.0**

- HTTP client library to send and receive web requests.
    
- Used for:
    
    - Querying Ollama API
        
    - Uploading documents to Open WebUI
        
    - Sending data to internal services
        
    

---

### **numpy>=1.26.4**

- Numerical array library used to support vector math and embeddings.
    
- Required by sentence-transformers.
    

---

### **sentence-transformers>=2.2.2**

- Provides pre-trained transformer models for embedding text.
    
- Used to generate vector embeddings of document chunks or queries.
    

---

### **langchain>=0.1.16**

- Modular framework to build LLM pipelines.
    
- Used to:
    
    - Connect retrievers, prompts, and LLMs
        
    - Build RetrievalQA and RAG-CAG chains
        
    

---

### **langchain-docling>=0.1.3**

- Extension for langchain to integrate with docling.
    
- Loads structured document chunks (from PDF, DOCX, etc.).
    
- Enables more accurate text splitting and chunking compared to PyPDF2 alone.
