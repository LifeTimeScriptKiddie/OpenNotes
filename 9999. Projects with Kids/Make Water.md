| Solar Still          | Bowl, small cup, plastic wrap, rock, sun            | Set up still, observe     | Uses evaporation-condensation. Great for sunny days.            |
| Rainwater Collection | Clean containers, tarp (optional), rain             | Place containers, measure | Safe if collected directly. May still need boiling.             |
| Boiling Water        | Pot, heat source (fire/stove), dirty water          | Observe heating           | Adult only for heat. Kills microbes. Doesnâ€™t remove chemicals.  |
| DIY Sand Filter      | Bottle, cotton, sand, gravel, charcoal, dirty water | Build filter, pour water  | Filters dirt, not germs. Combine with boiling for safety.       |
| Plant Transpiration  | Clear plastic bag, leafy branch, sunlight           | Tie bag, watch over hours | Collects clean vapor from leaves. Slow but pure.                |
| UV Purification      | Clear plastic bottle, sunlight (6+ hours)           | Fill and place in sun     | Works best in direct UV. Inactivates many pathogens.            |
| Cloth Filtration     | Cloth, dirty water, container                       | Pour through cloth        | Removes large particles only. Not safe to drink without boiling |



### ðŸ’§ Water Collection & Purification (Minimal Resources)

#### 1.Â **Solar Still**

- Put salty or dirty water in a large bowl.
    
- Place a small cup in the center (donâ€™t let water spill in it).
    
- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, seal it tight.
    
- Put a rock in the center so it dips over the cup.
    
- Leave in sun for several hours.
    
- Water evaporates, condenses on plastic, and drips into cup.
    
- **Result:**Â Clean, distilled water. Great demo of water cycle.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Build setup, check water after hours.

#### 2.Â **DIY Sand Filter**

- Cut a plastic bottle in half.
    
- Invert the top like a funnel into the bottom.
    
- Layer bottom to top: cotton â†’ charcoal â†’ sand â†’ gravel.
    
- Pour muddy water slowly through the top.
    
- Filtered water collects at the bottom.
    
- **Result:**Â Clearer water, but still not drinkableâ€”boil after.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Build layers, pour and observe flow.
    

---

#### 3.Â **Boiling Water**

- Pour dirty water into a metal pot.
    
- Heat on fire or stove until rolling boil.
    
- Boil 1â€“3 minutes (longer at high elevation).
    
- Let cool before drinking.
    
- **Result:**Â Water is safe from bacteria/viruses.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Watch the boil, help time it.
    

---

#### 4.Â **Rainwater Collection**

- Set out clean bowls or buckets before it rains.
    
- Optional: create a funnel using a tarp tied above a bucket.
    
- After rain, strain out debris using cloth.
    
- **Result:**Â Generally safe if caught cleanâ€”boil if in doubt.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Set up, collect, measure, observe.
    

---

#### 5.Â **Plastic Bag on Plant (Transpiration)**

- Tie a clear plastic bag around a leafy green branch.
    
- Seal it tight and leave in sunlight.
    
- Water vapor collects and condenses inside.
    
- **Result:**Â Pure water from plant moisture.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Tie bag, check after a few hours.
    

---

#### 6.Â **UV Disinfection (SODIS)**

- Fill a clear plastic bottle with water.
    
- Place in full sun for 6+ hours.
    
- UV rays deactivate many pathogens.
    
- Works best on sunny days with clear water.
    
- **Result:**Â Safer water, but not effective on very dirty water.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Fill bottle, place in sun, observe.
    

---

#### 7.Â **Cloth Straining (Pre-Filter)**

- Pour water through a clean cloth into another container.
    
- Removes large debris and visible dirt.
    
- **Result:**Â Water looks cleaner, but not safe to drink yet.
    
- **Kid task:**Â Hold cloth, pour water, observe result.
