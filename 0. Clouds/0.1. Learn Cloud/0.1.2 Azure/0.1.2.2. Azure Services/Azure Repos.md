## GitHub vs. Azure Repos

One of the first elements that we will see after entering the Azure Repos project website ([Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/pl-pl/services/devops/repos)) is a link to GitHub, and it is not a bug at all. Microsoft rightly develops these two projects as entirely separate since they’re targeting different user groups.

### GitHub summary

GitHub is a git-based version control system developed with the developer community in mind and highly appreciated by it. It has always been oriented toward the open-source, though there are private repositories, too. What makes GitHub stand out so much? Definitely intuitiveness and ease of use. With high reliability, good documentation, and continuous innovation, it’s not surprising that so many teams and programmers simply love this solution.

### Azure Repos summary

Azure Repos is also a git-based version control system, but the similarities to GitHub end here. The solution is part of Azure DevOps and, as the name suggests, is focused on DevOps professionals and DevOps teams. It’s offered as one of the Azure cloud services and targets **private project repositories**. It’s part of several tools for planning, managing, programming, and implementing projects. As part of the overall solution from MS, **Azure Repos has also implemented tests and automation**, thanks to which teams can deliver projects faster and more efficiently. The difference is also the teams for which this solution is intended. 

GitHub is perfect for open-source code development and open-source projects, where programmers come from around the world, often with varying levels of knowledge and commitment to the project. **Azure DevOps is perfect for closed projects** developed by companies for which code is essential – its management, testing, and projects automation, all of these features are in high demand.
