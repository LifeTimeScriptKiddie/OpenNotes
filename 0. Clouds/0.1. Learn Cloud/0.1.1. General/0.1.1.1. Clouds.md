# 1. Intro

**Tester here.**

Cloud technology makes me dizzy. There are too many concepts, services, and so much lingo. Even though cloud computing has been around for over a decade, it still feels overwhelming.

As a **simple person**, I decided to approach cloud computing with a **systems engineering mindset**—stepping back to get a **50,000 ft view** of the big picture.

# 2. What & Why Systems Engineering?

A systems engineering approach breaks down complex systems into manageable pieces. This helps us understand, analyze, and eventually test and exploit them. 


Let’s oversimplify the process:

1. **Need:** Define the problem (use cases & feasibility)
2. **Requirements:** Identify functional, physical, interface, and constraint requirements
3. **Architecture & Design:** Develop high-level and low-level blueprints
4. **Implementation:** Build and configure the solution
5. **Integration:** Connect the new system with existing ones
6. **Verification & Validation:** Ensure the system works as expected
7. **Deployment & Operations:** Maintain, monitor, and scale the solution

==A side note== 
>  On that note, **Cost, Schedule, and Performance (CSP)** are core constraints that guide **decision-making and trade studies in Systems Engineering (SE)**. Systems engineers balance these factors throughout the system lifecycle to ensure successful delivery of complex systems.
> 
> Why am I bringing this up here? Because **this is a great way to communicate with stakeholders!**
> 
> As we can see, **security doesn’t naturally show up in the CSP triad**. Not many organizations (at least historically—maybe it’s changing now) are going to say, _“I want my system to be perfectly secure.”_
> 
> This makes our position as security engineers especially interesting. **We’re the ones who have to convince them to fix their system.** If we can **tie our findings to cost, schedule, or performance**, then **non-cyber folks** will understand the impact of a vulnerability much better—which ultimately leads to a stronger, more resilient product.

Before **smart people build cool things**, they follow this structured process. Let’s see how this works with a couple of examples.


## 2.1 Use Case 1: The Individual (Bob’s Home Server Journey)

Imagine **Bob** wants to access his data from anywhere. He’s probably tired of buying a new laptop every year. Instead of dropping cash on another machine, maybe he decides to build a **home server**.

This home server could run his own **local LLM**, store a bunch of **photos**, run **Kali Linux**, and more. Basically, a personal powerhouse that he can tap into whenever he wants. As long as Bob has internet access, he can remote into his **super-duper machine** and grab anything he needs. Sounds awesome, right?

To make that happen, Bob needs to take the following steps:
### Steps:

1. **The DIY Approach:**
   - Bob exposes his **router** to the internet.
	   - **Simple:** `Bob → Router → Home Computer`
   - He soon gets random connection requests from hackers.

9. **The First Fix:**
   - Bob adds a **firewall** and basic **username/password protection**.
   - **System Progression:**
     - **Enhanced:** `Bob → Firewall → IdM (Identity Management) → Router → Home Computer`

10. **Expanding Storage:**
   - Bob runs out of space and adds an **external hard drive**.
	   - **Enhanced+:** `Bob → Firewall → (IdM) → Router → Home Server (NAS) → Storage`
4. **Hardware Upgrades:**
   - After upgrading his **CPU**, Bob realizes that maintenance costs (RAM, CPU, RAID, UPS, etc.) are spiraling out of control.
	   - Enhanced++: `Bob → Firewall → (IdM) → Router → Home Server (NAS) → Storage → RAID → UPS → @`

**The Problem:** Even for one person, maintaining an IT setup can quickly become expensive and overly complex.

## 2.2 Use Case 2: The Business (AtoZ Cyber LLC)

AtoZ Cyber LLC is a small business that sells books and educational materials. They have employees distributed across the globe. Since their website is a major revenue source, it must be available 24/7 — any downtime results in lost profit. As a small company, their network started out relatively simple.
### **Stage 1: A Basic Setup**
**Scenarios:**

- **In-Person Workers:** `IdM → Internal Server`
- **Remote Workers:** `IdM → VPN → Firewall → Internal Server`
- **Customers:** `Firewall → Website → Data Server`

### **Stage 2: Growth & Complexity**

-As AtoZ Cyber grows:

- The customer base increases, requiring more scalable infrastructure.
    
- The volume of data grows, demanding better storage and redundancy.

**New Architecture:**

- **Customers:**  
  ` Load Balancer → Firewall/WAF →  Web Servers → Data Server (High Availability Setup) → CDN`
  
- **Remote Workers:**  
  ` IdM → VPN Gateway → Firewall → Internal Network`

**Business Pain Points:**

- Rising hardware and maintenance costs
- The need for 24/7 availability and scalability
- Increased security risks with more complex architectures



---

# 3. Enter the Cloud

Both use cases highlight two major challenges:

- **Scalability:** Systems shall **grow on demand**.
- **Availability:** Systems shall be **online 24/7** without downtime.

## 3.1 How Cloud Solves This?

Cloud computing addresses these issues by outsourcing infrastructure management. Instead of buying, maintaining, and securing physical hardware, businesses leverage cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

💡 **With just an internet connection, businesses can scale globally—without the headache of managing hardware.**

| **2. Requirements**              | Define compute, storage, security, and cost constraints.<br><br>_"I expect my data to be secure and services to be affordable."_ |
| **3. Architecture & Design**     | Cloud blueprints (e.g., microservices, multi-region setup).                                                                      |

### **Cloud Development Requirements Specification**

#### **1. General Requirements**

1.1 The cloud-based system **shall** provide **scalable** infrastructure to support business growth.  
1.2 The system **shall** ensure **high availability (99.9% uptime or higher)** to meet customer expectations.  
1.3 The cloud platform **shall** support **multi-region deployment** to enhance performance and redundancy.  
1.4 The solution **shall** integrate with **on-premises systems** when necessary.

#### **2. Security Requirements**

2.1 The system **shall** enforce **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** policies to restrict unauthorized access.  
2.2 The cloud infrastructure **shall** comply with **industry security standards** (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST).  
2.3 Data at rest **shall** be encrypted using **AES-256**, and data in transit **shall** be secured with **TLS 1.2 or higher**.  
2.4 The system **shall** provide **DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF)** capabilities.  
2.5 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) **shall** be enforced for privileged accounts.

#### **3. Performance & Scalability Requirements**

3.1 The cloud infrastructure **shall** **auto-scale** to handle peak traffic loads without service degradation.  
3.2 The system **shall** provide **low-latency content delivery** through a CDN for global users.  
3.3 Cloud services **shall** support **serverless computing** to optimize cost and resource efficiency.

#### **4. Reliability & Availability Requirements**

4.1 The system **shall** implement **disaster recovery mechanisms** with an **RTO (Recovery Time Objective) ≤ 30 minutes**.  
4.2 The cloud provider **shall** offer **SLA-backed uptime guarantees** for critical services.  
4.3 The cloud architecture **shall** support **multi-zone redundancy** for fault tolerance.

#### **5. Compliance & Governance Requirements**

5.1 The cloud environment **shall** support **audit logging and monitoring** to detect security incidents.  
5.2 All deployments **shall** follow **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** best practices for consistency.  
5.3 The system **shall** enforce **least privilege access** for all cloud resources.

#### **6. Customer Experience Requirements**

6.1 The system **shall** provide a **fast, responsive, and intuitive user interface** for customers.  
6.2 Authentication and login processes **shall** be **secure yet user-friendly** (e.g., SSO & OAuth support).  
6.3 Customer support **shall** be available **24/7** to handle critical issues.
