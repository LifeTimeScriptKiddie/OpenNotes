# 3.5 Connection Type


### Error Explanation: Field `SomeField` Doesn't Exist on Type `SomeType`

The error message indicates that the field `SomeField` does not exist on the type `SomeType`. This often happens when `SomeType` is a connection type used for pagination, rather than a straightforward object type.




Step 1.  Search for all types and look for "Connection"  which is a common naming convention for connection types, and search for ones with `edges` and `nodes`
```
{
  __schema {
    types {
      name
    }
  }
}

```
Step 2. Search for specific type. 
```
{
  __type(name: "UserCoreConnection") {
    name
    fields {
      name
      type {
        name
        kind
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example result. Notice edges and pageinfo. 
```
{
  "data": {
    "__type": {
      "name": "UserCoreConnection",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "edges",
          "type": {
            "name": null,
            "kind": "LIST"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "pageInfo",
          "type": {
            "name": "PageInfo",
            "kind": "OBJECT"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```




## Connection Types in GraphQL

Connection types are used to handle lists of items with pagination. Instead of directly returning a list of objects, a connection type typically includes:
- **`edges`**: An array of items, where each item is wrapped in an `edge`.
- **`node`**: The actual object (like `UserCore`) within the `edge`.
- **`pageInfo`**: Information about the pagination, such as whether there are more pages (`hasNextPage`).

## Example of a Connection Type Structure

```graphql
type UserCoreConnection {
  edges: [UserCoreEdge]
  pageInfo: PageInfo
}

type UserCoreEdge {
  node: UserCore
  cursor: String
}

type PageInfo {
  endCursor: String
  hasNextPage: Boolean
}

type UserCore {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  email: String
}
```

### Accessing Fields within a Connection

To access fields like `id`, `name`, and `email` from the `UserCore` type within a connection, you need to drill down from `edges` to `node`:

```graphql
{
  users {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
        email
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      endCursor
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`edges`**: Contains the array of `UserCoreEdge`.
- **`node`**: The `UserCore` object inside each `edge`, where you can access the `id`, `name`, and `email` fields.
- **`pageInfo`**: Provides pagination details, like whether there are more pages to load (`hasNextPage`) and the cursor for the last item (`endCursor`).
