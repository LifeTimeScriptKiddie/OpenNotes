## Three-Level Architecture

Here’s the most basic three-level architecture:

```mermaid
---
config:
  theme: base
  themeVariables:
    nodeTextColor: "#FFFFFF"
    primaryColor: "#000000"
    lineColor: "#FFFFFF"
    edgeLabelBackground: "#000000"
  gitGraph:
    showBranches: false
---

graph LR
	A[User] ---> B
	B[Web application] ---> C
	C[Database]

classDef default fill:#000000,stroke:#FFFFFF,color:#FFFFFF;
```

This is fine in theory, but real life doesn’t work this way. There are many users, each with different needs, spread across various locations. This is where additional components of a web application come into play.

It’s kinda funny how you can take the same basic graph and tweak it a little to represent real-world complexity. But in reality, web applications involve way more moving parts.

## Key Components of a Web Application

| **Component**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DNS (Domain Name System)**       | Translates domain names (e.g., google.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 85.129.83.120), acting as the internet’s "phone book."                                                                    |
| **Load Balancer**                  | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scaling and fault tolerance.                                                                                        |
| **Web Application Servers**        | Execute business logic, handle user requests, and interact with databases and other services. Implemented using languages/frameworks like Node.js (Express), Ruby (Rails), and PHP (Laravel). |
| **Database Servers**               | Store and manage structured data using SQL (relational) or NoSQL (non-relational) databases. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.                                                            |
| **Caching Service**                | Stores frequently accessed data for quick retrieval, reducing computation and database load. Common tools: Redis, Memcache.                                                                   |
| **Job Queue & Servers**            | Process asynchronous tasks (e.g., email sending, indexing, data processing) using job queues like RabbitMQ or AWS SQS.                                                                        |
| **Full-text Search Service**       | Enables fast searching of text-based data using inverted indexes. Popular tools: Elasticsearch, Apache Solr.                                                                                  |
| **Services (Microservices)**       | Modular components handling specific tasks like authentication, payments, or data processing. Examples: Account service, content service, payment service.                                    |
| **Data Pipeline**                  | Collects, processes, and analyzes event data. Uses tools like AWS Kinesis, Kafka, and Redshift for storage and analytics.                                                                     |
| **Cloud Storage**                  | Stores and retrieves data via a RESTful API. Common provider: AWS S3.                                                                                                                         |
| **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** | Distributes static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, videos) across global servers for faster loading times.                                                                                   |
|                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                               |
