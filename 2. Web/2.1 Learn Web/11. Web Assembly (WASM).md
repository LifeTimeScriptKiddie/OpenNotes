# 1. What is WebAssembly (WASM) on the Web?


## 1.1 BLUF

WebAssembly (`.wasm`) is a low-level binary format that allows developers to run fast, compiled code inside the browser. It’s like running C, C++, or Rust on the web with near-native performance. For bug bounty hunters, it’s often used to hide or optimize logic that might be interesting to reverse or exploit.

## 1.2 What is WebAssembly?

### It is:

- A compact binary format (`.wasm`)
    
- Meant to run alongside JavaScript in the browser
    
- Portable and secure, designed to execute in a sandboxed environment
    
- Supported by all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    

### It is not:

- A replacement for JavaScript (yet)
    
- Easy to read or write manually
    
- Designed for dynamic runtime logic like JS

## 1.3 Why Do Developers Use WebAssembly?

| Use Case                 | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Cryptographic operations | For speed and safety with hashes or keys    |
| Game engines / 3D        | High-performance rendering and interaction  |
| Compression / codecs     | Fast processing of files and streams        |
| PDF / CAD / AI tools     | Porting complex native libraries to browser |
| Security logic           | Attempt to hide business logic from users   |

## 1.4 How Is WebAssembly Used on the Web?

WebAssembly is typically loaded using JavaScript. Here’s a common example:

```js
fetch('module.wasm')
  .then(response => response.arrayBuffer())
  .then(buffer => WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer, { env: {} }))
  .then(wasmModule => {
    wasmModule.instance.exports.doSomething();
  });
```

- The `.wasm` file is fetched like any static file.
    
- It is instantiated with an optional import object.
    
- Functions can then be called from JS.

## 1.5 WebAssembly for Bug Bounty Hunting

For bug bounty hunters, `.wasm` files are juicy targets because they might:

- Include business logic previously hidden in JavaScript
    
- Perform client-side validation checks (PIN, passwords, signatures)
    
- Contain hardcoded secrets or keys
    
- Perform crypto or encoding tasks that are normally obfuscated
    

### What to look for:

- Functions like `validate`, `encrypt`, `verify`
    
- Constants, strings, base64 blobs
    
- Memory manipulations or manual encoding
    
- Exposed exports you can call or abuse
    

---

## 1.6 Security Perspective

WebAssembly is safe in the sense that:

- It runs in the browser’s sandbox
    
- It cannot access your filesystem or OS
    

But from a security research standpoint:

- `.wasm` can be decompiled (e.g. to `.wat`)
    
- Logic can be patched, recompiled, and tested
    
- Exports can be directly called or fuzzed
    
- Vulnerabilities in the logic can be exploited
